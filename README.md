# To-Do List Application

This simple **To-Do List** application allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. Built using **HTML, CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the application features a clean and minimalistic design with functionality to add and remove tasks dynamically.

### Key Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks by typing in the input field and either clicking the "Add" button or pressing "Enter."
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a delete button ("X") to remove it from the list when no longer needed.
- **Dynamic User Interface**: The task list is updated dynamically without refreshing the page.
- **User-Friendly Layout**: The application uses a flexbox layout for the input and button, ensuring that the design remains responsive and accessible.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface, including the background and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the dynamic addition and deletion of to-do items.

This project is a great example of integrating JavaScript with the DOM to create interactive, client-side web applications.

#### Output:

#### 1. The initial state of the To-Do List application with an input field and "Add" button. The background image is displayed, and the interface is ready for the user to add tasks.
